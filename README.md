# Aalyzing-customer-sentiment-to-understand-public-perception-and-feedback
This project involves analyzing customer sentiment to understand public perception and feedback. The analysis utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques on Amazon Alexa product reviews to derive insights.

# Key Tasks
The key task of the project was first to understand the Problem Statement and Business Case:

- Analyzed customer sentiment using reviews.
Import Libraries and Datasets:
Utilized pandas, numpy, seaborn, and matplotlib for data handling and visualization.
Imported the dataset from Google Drive.

- Explore Dataset:
Conducted initial data exploration to understand the structure and contents of the dataset.

- Perform Data Cleaning:
Cleaned the data to prepare for analysis, including handling missing values.

- Remove Punctuation from Text:
Implemented text preprocessing to remove punctuation for better analysis.

- Remove Stopwords:
Filtered out common stopwords to focus on meaningful words in the reviews.

- Perform Count Vectorization (Tokenization):
Applied tokenization to convert text data into numerical data.

- Apply Data Cleaning:
Combined all preprocessing steps for a comprehensive data cleaning process.

# Understand Naive Bayes Theory and Intuition:
Explored the theoretical background of the Naive Bayes algorithm for sentiment classification.

# Learning Outcomes
- Gained practical experience in data cleaning and preprocessing for NLP tasks.
- Learned to apply count vectorization and understand its importance in text analysis.
- Deepened understanding of the Naive Bayes algorithm and its application in sentiment analysis.
- Enhanced skills in using Python libraries for data analysis and visualization.
